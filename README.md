# rc
Configuration files to keep my dev environment looking fresh across all machines.

To apply these, download this repo on to the machine you'd like to format. Have your bash profile/rc 
source them (either with an absolute path or symlinking them to the same directory). Symlink the 
.gitconfig file to the home directory. Pull as needed.
